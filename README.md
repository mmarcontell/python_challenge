# Python Challenge

Using python, my goal was to read, organize, and write an analysis of large data sets.

The first data set was sorting through bank profit and losses, and to export a write-up of the average, min, and max changes in profits over the months provided. The second data set was to sort through voting results, and determine how many votes a candidate recieved, what the overall percent of votes were, and the outcome of the election.
